This error occurs when using a library that doesn't properly handle the background color in combination with certain image formats or rendering methods.  It's often seen when a component with a transparent background is placed over a component with a different background color, and the result is a visual artifact where the underlying background color is visible through areas intended to be transparent. This is especially prevalent in older versions of React Native and specific Android devices.
