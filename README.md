# React Native Transparent Component Background Rendering Issue

This repository demonstrates a common bug in React Native where transparent components don't render correctly, especially on some Android devices. The issue manifests as visual artifacts, where the background color bleeds through areas intended to be transparent.

The `TransparentBackgroundBug.js` file showcases the problem, while `TransparentBackgroundSolution.js` provides a potential fix using techniques like specifying background color explicitly or using a different approach to achieve transparency.

## How to reproduce

1. Clone the repository
2. Navigate to the project directory
3. Run `npx react-native run-android` or `npx react-native run-ios`
4. Observe the visual artifacts on an affected device (Android in this example)

## Solution

The solution file `TransparentBackgroundSolution.js` provides a few potential ways to mitigate this issue.  This often involves managing the underlying background color carefully or using image formats that are better handled by React Native on Android.
